Introduction: Basically, a riddle app, which uses the features of the Cognitive API and Face Recognition API. A picture taken through the camera can be processed to capture the human emotion/expression. Once the processing is done the user can access the riddles displayed based on the emotion recognized by the Cognitive and Face Recognition API's and share them with their friends and family.
Purpose: The purpose is to include fun and suspense in guessing the riddle with help of the expressions/emotions. It would be a fun element to the user, as he could choose among the 100 riddles displayed based on specific expression/emotion; it would off course be a suspense factor to the sender as he need to guess the riddle and also decrypt the message sent by the user.
